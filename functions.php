 * If your child theme has more than one .css file (eg. ie.css, style.css, main.css) then
 * you will have to make sure to maintain all of the parent theme dependencies.
 *
 * Make sure you're using the correct handle for loading the parent theme's styles.
 * Failure to use the proper tag will result in a CSS file needlessly being loaded twice.
 * This will usually not affect the site appearance, but it's inefficient and extends your page's loading time.
